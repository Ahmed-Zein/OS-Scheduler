# Operating System Scheduler

## Overview

This project is a simulation of different CPU scheduling algorithms for an Operating System. The project supports both
preemptive and non-preemptive scheduling algorithms.

## Supported Algorithms

The following scheduling algorithms are supported:

- First Come, First Served (FCFS)
- Shortest Job First (SJF) (both preemptive and non-preemptive)
- Priority Scheduling (both preemptive and non-preemptive)
- Round Robin

## Installation

1. Clone the repository to your local machine.
2. Make sure you have Java installed on your machine.
3. Open the project in your preferred Java IDE (such as IntelliJ or Eclipse).

## Customizable Simulation Parameters

The simulation parameters can be customized, including:

- Time quantum for Round Robin scheduling
- Priority levels for Priority scheduling

## Simulation Results

The simulation provides the following performance metrics:

- Average waiting time
- Average turnaround time

## GUI

The simulation includes a graphical user interface (GUI) to visualize the CPU scheduling algorithms in action. Users can
add processes and adjust simulation parameters through the GUI.
